Library Manager



The Library Management System is a software application designed to streamline and automate the day-to-day operations of a library. It allows librarians to efficiently manage book records, track the issuance and return of books, maintain member details, and monitor due dates and late fees. The system provides features such as book and member management, search functionality, and report generation, ensuring quick access to accurate information while reducing manual work and errors. By digitizing library processes, it enhances productivity, improves service quality for members, and offers a user-friendly interface for both librarians and users.
